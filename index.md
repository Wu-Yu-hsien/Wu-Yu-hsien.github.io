This project showcases my skills in building an end-to-end machine learning pipeline for mental health classification using psychotherapy dialogue. Leveraging Python, scikit-learn, SQL, and data visualization libraries, I demonstrated my ability to extract and preprocess real-world text data, train interpretable models, and apply diagnostic predictions to support clinical or insurance decision-making.
